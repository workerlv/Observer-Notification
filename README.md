# Observer-Notification

Simple example (Swift 4.1):
 * It is simple example how observers-notifications work, in real life problem this example is better made with protocols-delegates
 
 
 Theory:
 * Communication patterns - the way how to views can communicate with each other
 * Comunication patterns are - protocols/ delegates and notifications/ observers
 * Delegates and protocols are one-to-one communication pattern
 * Notifications and patterns are one-to-many communication pattern
